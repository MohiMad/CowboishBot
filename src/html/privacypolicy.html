        <h2>What data does Cowboish store?</h2>
        <p>By default, the bot does not store any Discord data on it's database. Which means that if you are not using
            any specific features of the bot none of your data is going to be stored.<br>
            The bot only saves data if it's needed. For instance, the bot stores the user's ID (<em>for example
                478527909250990090</em>) when a user runs a <em>Logicpath command</em>. The bot needs to have that ID
            stored in order to modify and access the user's "game account".
            <br><br>
            Additional stored data is the guild's (and optionally channels') ID, this is only saved by the bot if you
            use any of it's channel/guild features. For example, greeting/leave messages need to have guild's and the
            channel's ID stored in order for the bot to be able to send a greet/leave message there.
        </p>

        <h2>What if I want my data be removed?</h2>
        <p>Sure! Your data belongs to you and Cowboish only stores it if it's necessary. If you want your data to be
            removed from our service, contact the developer of the bot (<em>Mohi#2888</em>) on <a
                href="https://discord.com/invite/YWcSukS" target="_blank">Cowboish Server</a>. Note: this process can
            not be invoked, meaning that if you request to have your data removed then there is no way of getting your
            data back.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for using our service!
