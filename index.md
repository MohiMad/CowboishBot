Cowboish bot is the first 24/7 online hosted Identity V discord bot made by me >:D aka (**Mohi**)


## Command list :P

### LogicPath commands
We all enjoy opening essences and rolling dices, but what if youre poor and you can't open essences ingame :( ?
  Don't worry, because Cowboish bot allows you to roll dices and get rewards to open essences and all of your data
  will be saved in his database (Yes his cuz he aint no bot he has a life :v)

- ``quick`` ➤ Play a quick match as a survivor to get some dices

- ``hunt`` ➤ Hate being hunted? well you can hunt the survivors to get dices instead >:/

- ``roll`` ➤ Roll a 4 sided dice to get multiple rewards (Clues, Inspirations and essences)

- ``open`` ➤ Open an essence of your choice of the season's current essences (*s9-1*, *s9-2*, *coa*)

- ``logicpath`` ➤ Check your logicpath informations... How much clues/essences/dices you got

- ``daily`` ➤ Get a daily reward :D

### Identity V commands
Of course! Identity v commands must be available in order for **Cowboish bot** to be an Identity V bot right?

``identify`` ➤ identifies what kind of player you are ingame... more like an idv stereotypes command

``roll20`` ➤ rolls a 20 sided dice...

``essence`` ➤ open the previous season's essences (not included in LP commands) | available essences ("s8-1", "s8-2", "p5-1", "p5-2")

``randomize`` ➤ picks a random survivor/hunter for you. Maybe you're lost and dunno who to buy

``idv`` ➤ sends a random post from the reddit r/Identity V
